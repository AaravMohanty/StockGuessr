⭐ STOCKGUESSR — GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW (FINAL UPDATED VERSION)
1. Match Concept

StockGuessr is a fast-paced 1v1 price-action duel.
Two players face off on the same hidden historical month, using only price and news to trade.
The stock, year, and market context are not revealed.

Matches last 60–90 seconds, making gameplay quick, intense, and addictive.

2. Starting View: Past 3 Months

Before the match begins, players see:

A 3-month candlestick chart (daily candles)

Corresponding volume bars

No ticker, no dates — pure price action and volume only

This gives players context for trend, volatility, momentum, and structure.

3. Game Clock & Weekly Rounds

The match month is broken into 4 weekly segments.

Default pacing: 1 week ≈ 10–12 seconds

Each week contains a decision window of ~5–7 seconds

Each weekly cycle:

Daily candlesticks for that week appear (revealing the week’s full price action)

Weekly volume displays

Real news headlines from that historical week pop up

Players choose: BUY, SELL, or DO NOTHING

After the decision window ends, the game instantly moves to the next week.

This loop continues until all four weeks are revealed.

4. Trading Rules

Every player starts with $100,000 in virtual capital

Players may:

BUY (enter long)

SELL (enter short, or close long)

DO NOTHING

Players can only hold one position at a time

There is no limit on number of trades

Positions automatically close at the end of Week 4 at the month’s final price

The design emphasizes meaningful, well-timed decisions, not spam trading.

5. Information Shown Each Week

For each week of the hidden month, players see:

Daily candlesticks for that week only

Daily volume bars

A mini “timeline” that fills as the month progresses

Real historical news headlines that happened during that specific week

A large, clear BUY / SELL / DO NOTHING interface

A visible countdown timer for the decision window

No stock name.
No dates.
No indicators.
Only raw price, volume, and news.

This keeps the game skill-based and mystery-driven.

6. Scoring

Scoring is intentionally simple:

Final Score = Final Portfolio Value

The player with the higher final value wins.

No extra bonuses.
No multipliers.
No efficiency scoring.
No risk or style bonuses.

Pure trading skill and decision-making determine victory.

7. End-of-Match Reveal

At the end of Week 4:

All positions are auto-closed

Final equity curves are shown

Trade markers appear on the candlestick chart

Winner is declared

The true historical identity is revealed:
(e.g., “This was: NVIDIA, March 2020”)

This moment creates the same dopamine hit as GeoGuessr:
“You mean this was the pre-earnings run?!”
“No wonder volume spiked!”

8. Why the Game Has a Huge Skill Gap

Skilled players will dominate by:

Recognizing chart formations

Reading news context quickly

Reacting to volume shifts

Using “do nothing” wisely

Identifying famous historical patterns

Timing entries and exits precisely

Understanding how stocks behave around catalysts

Beginners tend to:

Buy when price is peaking

Panic sell dips

Misread news

Misjudge trends

Trade too often or at the wrong time

The result is a massive difference in win rate, making the game competitive and rewarding mastery.
